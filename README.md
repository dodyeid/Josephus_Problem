# Josephus Problem
I develop an algorithm to solve the Josephus Problem!

## What is the Josephus Problem?
Imagine a circle of n people indexed 1 to n. They are all alive to begin. Starting from 1, the kth person amongst the living people gets killed. This continues until there is one survivor.

The question is: given n and k, what position is safe from death?

## My First Solution
I built an algorithm that plays the game given n and k, and then spits out the last survivor.

## Possible Future Solution
There is potential to use recursion here, though this is a work in progress for me.
